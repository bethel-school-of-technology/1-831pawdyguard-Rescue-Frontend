        <section>I was asked to share a bit of my story. To be honest,
          it is the first time somebody asked me to write about my life.
          I feel honored and I'm so excited! <br><br>Let's start with the simple stuff to warm up.
          I live in Salinas, CA with my lovely homy Nia Casad. And it's not too far fetched to say, I owe her my life.
          <br>
          Nia's mum was rescuing pets back in the day, so she grew up with a big heart for animals, a good example
          and she followed in the footsteps of her mum.
          At 10 Nia started volunteering at a vet, learning animal care from scratch, was hired with 16, and stepped
          out to do her own rescue with 19.
          <br><br>We met through a TNR program. I was trapped as a little kitten. My lucky day, I tell you. I would have
          died without it. Nia was called and she took me in.
          For the next three weeks she kept me at her side, fed me, bought medication, made sure I would survive. And I
          did.
          And because I'm so incredibly cute and charming, she decided that I could live with her. What shall I say, she
          couldn't but love me!
          And I know, I'm 'just' a cat, but her animal rescue made a huge difference, for me and hundreds of others.
          <br><br>
          And what I see - it even makes a difference for the people who donate and volunteer. It brings the best out
          of them.
          Thank you for your support- the time and the money you invest!<br><br>
          Yours sincerely, Pitter </section>

        <p>Often we get asked, whether we sell animals. <br> The answer is No! <br>
          But if you want to adopt an animal, we kindly ask for a donation.
          These donations barely cover our cost for vaccination, medical check-up and so on, but it helps us to
          get around. And it helps to prepare our animals for their new forever homes.
